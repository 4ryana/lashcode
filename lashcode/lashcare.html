                        Eyelash extensions are individual synthetic material. They are attached to your eyelash
                        individually not to the skin. Each synthetic lash is attached to an eyelash. It is a very
                        enhancing beauty service and you DO NOT need to use any Mascara while wearing these eyelash
                        extensions. It is a very careful and intense service which requires skill and precision. Once
                        applied these lashes are so natural looking it is difficult to tell even up close that you have
                        extensions on. Eyelash extensions are not for everyone. This is a very high maintenance beauty
                        treatment. It requires very gentle care in order for the lashes to last long and stay in good
                        condition. Once the lashes are attached you must not rub or pull on them.

                        It is an individual process. We lose one Eyelash almost everyday. We also grow a new lash to
                        replace the one that fell out. These Lashes can stay on up to 2 full Months with proper care and
                        maintenance. However, factors such as eyelash growth, lifestyle and general after care will
                        affect how long the lashes last. Please do not attempt to remove any lashes on your own, seek
                        professional help from your technician.

                        appointment, or bring a lens case and remove them when you arrive at your appointment. Plan to
